TO DO:
- parallelize KL cost
- test on small 3d data (try to recover spiral or line)
- try other gradient descent methods
- check Hilber-Smith indipendence criterion
- check KMeans++ for choosing the neighbours
- gene similarity score across two gene networks ?
- initialize the matrix from CCA
- understand better the crowding problem
- good projection for reducing the noise?
- Sammon mapping
- Find a good dataset for testing!!!

- time the algorithm (comparae si CCA/ no CCA)
- compare results with CCA (and later maybe NKCCA and NCCA too)
